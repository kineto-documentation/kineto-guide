# Create a Website or App With Kineto 🚀

Welcome to Kineto, the AI-powered platform designed to help you easily create websites and web applications – no code, just chat.

Whether you're building a personal project or a professional app, Kineto will bring your ideas to life.

### Here’s how it works

- **Describe your app:** Simply tell Kineto what your app needs to do, and it will take care of the rest.
- **Generate and preview:** Watch as your web application is created, and preview its functionality to see whether there’s anything you want to change. 
- **Edit and refine:** Fine-tune your app’s features, design, and style until it’s exactly what you imagined. You can do this via the chat or manually on the meta-layer by dragging and changing the layout, images, and texts.
- **Enjoy your app:** Once you’re happy with it, your app will be deployed, making it ready for use. Share it with friends, or use it for work or personal projects.

### What you can build with Kineto

Kineto works best when asked to build apps with single-value or mostly single-value functionality. Within that scope, it can build just about anything you can think of:

- Educational or entertainment websites or apps, such as quizzes, small games, etc.
- Websites for your business, portfolio, or side projects.
-  Personal or professional apps and dashboards.
