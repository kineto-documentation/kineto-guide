### **It all starts with a prompt.** 

Think about the app or website that you want to build and describe it in detail by answering these questions: 

1. **Basic details**: Do you see your future product as an app or a website? Or is it perhaps a widget?
2. **Capabilities**: What should your app do? How will you or your audience interact with it? 
3. **Design**: What does your app look like? Should it use bright colours and emojis, or maybe even a specific color palette, or should it be more professional and minimalistic? 
4. **Context**: Do you have any references that provide additional context? Share them with Kineto so it understands better what you need. 
5. **Special features**: Do you want your app to have any special features, such as integration with Google Maps or Google Docs? 

### **Once your app or website is ready, preview and test it.** 

Is the result what you asked for, or do you want to change something? Make as many changes as you need to ensure your website looks exactly the way you want it to. 

### **Creating your app may take time**. 

Depending on the complexity of your project, generating an app with Kineto may require anywhere between 20 minutes and several hours. Don’t worry, Kineto will send you an email when your app is ready.
