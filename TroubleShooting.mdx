**Kineto misunderstood my request**\
Try explaining in more detail or uploading a screenshot for reference. If the results still aren’t what you expect, you can always ask for help on Discordill our Support Request Form.

**Kineto is stuck during code generation**\
Click **Stop** and resend your request. If that doesn’t work, report the bug with a link and screenshot on Discord.

**There’s an error**\
Click **Try again**. If there’s no option to do so, contact support on Discord.

**A recent change broke the project**\
Go to **View history** (the icon above the chat), select a previous version that worked well, and click _Restore_.

**The preview screen is gray, but no error appears**\
This usually means something went wrong during the final project build. Ask Kineto to make a small change – that often fixes the issue. If it doesn’t, ask for help on Discord or fill our Support Request Form
